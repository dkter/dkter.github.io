        <p>
            A few <s>weeks</s>months ago, Instagram, the social network that loves to throw a new (or stolen) idea
            at the wall every couple days, added a new feature called &quot;Notes&quot;. In case you're
            reading this in the future long after Instagram killed Notes because nobody was using them (or you just don't use Instagram), Notes
            are short 60-character text-only posts that only your mutual followers can see,
            that show up at the top of your DMs page. You can only post one Note at a time,
            and they get deleted 24 hours after you post them.
        </p>

        <p>
            There was a bit of excitement over the Notes feature when they first came out, but it
            died down pretty quickly. I don't think I've seen a new Note posted in several days. Maybe it's because the
            60-character limit is a little too restrictive and people just don't have that
            much to say in 60 characters, or maybe the rollout was a bit too messy.
            Whenever an app like Instagram rolls out a significant New Thing &mdash; be it a new
            feature, a redesign of some interface, or something else along those lines &mdash;
            they like to roll it out to a random selection of their users first, to make
            sure they like it (they'll probably use telemetry and bug reports from the app
            to make sure everything's working correctly and people can still use the app).
            This practice is called A/B testing, and it's much cheaper than hiring a team
            of testers, so naturally Instagram uses it a little too much. Notes, for example, are
            meant to be a social feature &mdash; they don't work great if you post something and
            half of your friends can't even see it. But A/B testing seems to be part of the
            Instagram formula, so of course, when Notes rolled out, many accounts weren't
            even able to see them.
        </p>

        <p>
            I was chatting with a friend who was frustrated at not being able to use Notes, and
            started wondering whether it was possible to read people's Notes without the
            app having the feature enabled. The app is just a client &mdash; when you open the
            DM page with the notes at the top, all the app does is send a request to the
            Instagram server asking to see all of your friends' notes. What I was hoping is
            that if I could write a program to send that same request, the Instagram server
            would send me the notes, thinking I was the app, regardless of whether
            Instagram had decided to enable the feature for me. My hope was that instead of
            flat-out disabling the Notes feature, Instagram had just changed some hidden
            setting in the client apps so that they would never request Notes, and the
            server would just assume that whoever requests to see Notes would be a client
            with Notes enabled and just send over the Notes without asking too many
            questions.
        </p>

        <p>
            I decided to test this out. I had Notes enabled on my main account, but I had a test
            account left over from a previous project that didn't seem to have Notes
            enabled. The first step was to see what kind of request the Instagram app was
            sending to the server, so that I could replicate it. Instagram, like most
            apps, uses HTTP requests to communicate with its server, and an HTTP
            request has three important parts that I need to know in order to replicate it:
        </p>

        <ul type=disc>
            <li>
                The request type: this is a short verb that signifies what the request is doing. For example, a <code>GET</code>
                request is usually used to get data from a server, and a <code>POST</code> request is
                usually used to post data to a server. Since we are getting data, there's
                a very good chance that this will be a <code>GET</code> request, unless Facebook wanted
                to be deliberately confusing (you'd think this never happens, but some websites
                are extremely poorly designed).
            </li>
            <li>
                The URL: this indicates which specific part of the website or service you want to request. In this case,
                there's probably a specific URL for getting notes.
            </li>
            <li>
                The data: this is any additional data that the server needs in order to carry out the request.
                For example, the server will probably need some sort of login information to make
                sure we're not trying to read the notes from someone else's account.
                (There are several ways of providing data, but it all has the same
                purpose).
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            HTTP requests are used all over the place. For example, your web browser used one to
            get the article you're reading right now:
        </p>

        <ul type=disc>
            <li>
                The request type was <code>GET</code>, since your web browser was getting the article.
            </li>
            <li>
                The URL was <code>david.industries/notes/notes.html</code>, which specifies the server
                (<code>david.industries</code>) and tells it which article you want to read (<code>/notes/notes.html</code>).
            </li>
            <li>
                My website doesn't really need any data, but your web browser will send some data to every website
                just in case it finds it useful &mdash; like which OS and web browser you're
                using, or the current date and time.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            So I needed to be able to see the requests the Instagram app was sending to the
            server. This is easy if you're using a website: every web browser (at least on
            desktop computers) lets you see which requests it's sending if you right-click
            on the page, click Inspect Element, then go to the Network tab. (You can try
            this yourself and check for the things I mentioned above). Unfortunately,
            Instagram Notes weren't enabled yet on the Instagram website &mdash; they were only on the iOS
            and Android apps. This meant I had to find a way to see the requests that were being sent
            from my phone.
        </p>

        <p>
            I did some digging and found a handy tool called <a href="https://httptoolkit.tech/">HTTP
            Toolkit</a> that let me do just that. So I connected my phone to HTTP Toolkit
            on my laptop and tried loading Instagram's notes page on my phone, but I wasn't
            getting any useful data.
        </p>

        <p>
            The issue, as it turns out, was the encryption. Like most apps, Instagram encrypts
            its HTTP requests using a scheme called TLS, or transport-layer security (this
            system as a whole is often referred to as HTTPS). Encryption is important for
            preventing people from spying on what you're doing online: for example, without
            encryption, if you were to connect to a public Wi-Fi network, whoever owns that
            network would be able to see every detail of every HTTP request you send. This
            includes usernames, passwords, and every bit of private data that you access
            online. With TLS encryption, every HTTP request you send is encrypted in a way
            such that only the server can decrypt it. This means someone who's not supposed
            to access this data, such as the public Wi-Fi owner, can't access it.
        </p>

        <p>
            How can you encrypt something in a way that only the server can decrypt it? You use one
            of the most important tools in computer science: public-key
            cryptography. The idea is that the server generates two keys: a public key and
            a private key. You can use the public key to encrypt data, but you can only
            decrypt that data with the private key. The server will send you the public key
            to encrypt your HTTP requests with, but it will never send the private key to
            anyone. This means if you encrypt a message with the public key that the server
            sends you, and then send it to the server, nobody but the server will be able to
            decrypt it.
        </p>

        <p>
            But how can you be sure that the server is the one sending you the public key, and not
            some evil hacker? Going back to this hypothetical public Wi-Fi owner, maybe
            they could intercept the server's message and send you a public key of their
            own, rather than the server's. Then, when you encrypt your HTTP requests and
            send them over, the public Wi-Fi owner will be able to decrypt them, since they
            have the private key rather than the server having it.
        </p>

        <p>
            TLS solves this problem using <em>certificates</em>.
            A certificate is a document that certifies that a particular website owns a
            specific public key. In order to verify that a certificate is legitimate, every
            device has a specific set of centralized <em>certificate
            authorities</em> that it trusts. These certificate authorities sign off on
            every certificate for every public key used by every website. Your device can
            verify that a certificate was actually signed by a certificate authority using,
            again, public-key cryptography! There are a bunch of public keys corresponding
            to each certificate authority that just sit on your device, and each
            certificate authority can encrypt the certificate using their private key. If
            you can decrypt the certificate using one of the public keys that correspond to
            the certificate authorities that you trust, you know that one of those
            certificate authorities must have signed off on that certificate, and therefore
            you can trust the certificate.
        </p>

        <p>
            Here's the issue now: I want to be able to see the HTTP requests that Instagram is
            sending, but Instagram is encrypting them with a public key that only the
            Instagram server can decode. I want Instagram to also encrypt the requests with
            a public key that I can decode. The public keys that correspond to each website
            are determined by a certificate authority. If I can create my own certificate
            authority and tell my phone to trust it, I can create another certificate for
            Instagram that tells the Instagram app to use my own public key to encrypt its
            requests, so that I can decrypt them. Luckily, HTTP Toolkit handles this for
            me.
        </p>

        <p>
            Unfortunately, if you add your own certificate authority, it will get marked as a
            user-installed certificate authority and most apps straight up won't trust it.
            This is probably a good thing: if you were to install a nefarious app that
            tricked you into installing its own certificate authority, that app would be
            able to see all of your HTTP requests, defeating the entire purpose of the
            encryption. There are some ways to install a certificate authority that doesn't
            get marked as user-installed, but it's purposefully difficult to do so, and you
            have to either be using an Android emulator (because installing certificates is
            useful for testing purposes, and people don't use emulators as their primary
            devices) or a rooted phone (because nobody can stop you from doing anything
            with a rooted phone).
        </p>

        <p>
            HTTP Toolkit also handles both of these situations for me (in fact, I'm just getting
            all of this information from the HTTP Toolkit documentation). So I tried using
            both an emulator and a rooted phone and again, neither worked. Then I read the
            HTTP Toolkit documentation a little further and found out that the Instagram
            app makes it especially hard to use your own certificates by keeping its own
            list of certificate authorities that it trusts, rather than just using the list
            that your phone uses for everything else. This is pretty much unnecessary for
            security purposes, given that it's already so hard to install a certificate
            that isn't marked as user-installed, and tricking random people into doing it
            is pretty much impossible. In fact, Android actively discourages this, because
            a side effect of doing this is that if the Instagram server were to switch to a
            different certificate authority, you would have to update the Instagram app in
            order to use it again (as opposed to just updating the list of certificate
            authorities on your device). Instagram likely does this because of old versions
            of Android (prior to Android 7.0, it apparently used to be much easier to
            install non-user certificates), which does seem like a valid concern. It could
            also be because Instagram doesn't want people to be able to easily do what I'm
            trying to do, because then they would be able to create alternative Instagram
            apps that don't show people ads, and Instagram doesn't like that.
        </p>

        <p>
            Turns out Instagram isn't the only app that behaves like this. Fortunately, the fine
            folks at HTTP Toolkit have thought about this as well, and <a
            href="https://httptoolkit.tech/blog/frida-certificate-pinning/">provided a
            script</a> using Frida (a tool that lets you rewrite parts of an Android app)
            to try to make these problematic apps behave more normally. I tried it, and it
            didn't work, and then I read further down that documentation page (a common
            theme in this story) and found out that Instagram makes things even more
            difficult than these already-difficult apps by completely rewriting the code
            that does all the TLS stuff, instead of using the code that every other app on
            your phone uses, meaning it would be much harder to disable all this behaviour
            and the HTTP Toolkit people haven't bothered.
        </p>

        <p>
            So how do I get around this, then? Fortunately, there is one group of people the
            Instagram team wants to have access to their HTTP requests: security
            researchers. Remember how Instagram crowdsources testing for its app, instead of paying a dedicated team of testers? Well, they
            do the same thing for security, except with a few differences: security
            researchers volunteer to test for them, and Instagram actually pays them when
            they find an issue. This is known as a bug bounty program, and it's probably even more common than A/B testing. Instagram knows
            that even though it's very hard for someone to get access to their HTTP
            requests, it will never be impossible, and they want security researchers to be
            able to get ahead of the bad guys. That's why they offer a way to disable all
            of this stuff for people going for bug bounties. I didn't have a bug bounty to
            claim, but I did want access to those HTTP requests.
        </p>

        <p>
            How do I get access? Well, first I need to create a Facebook account and link it with my
            Instagram account, and then sign up for Facebook's Bug Bounty Program, and then
            I can enable &quot;whitehat settings&quot; in the Instagram app. (More info <a
            href="https://www.facebook.com/notes/977148692766914/">here</a>.) After all
            that, there's a simple toggle switch in Instagram's settings that disables all
            of the weird stuff around certificates, even letting you use certificate
            authorities that are marked as user-installed. It puts a giant red banner at
            the bottom of your screen, and it auto-disables itself after some time, but it
            works!
        </p>

        <p>
            I should point out that none of what I've done so far constitutes &quot;hacking&quot; or
            security research or anything like that. I haven't even begun to get to the
            point yet. Inspecting HTTP requests is a pretty normal thing to do, and it
            would have taken two clicks if I were using a browser (this is because the
            browser can just show you the requests before it encrypts them, since it knows
            you're the only one who's going to see them). The reason I spent so long
            talking about this part is because it took me by far the most time. The part
            after this took me comparatively no time at all.
        </p>

        <p>OKAY so, now I can see some requests. Let's take a look.</p>

        <img src="img/ignotes/get_notes_response.png" alt="HTTP Toolkit showing me an HTTP response with code 200 for a GET request to i.instagram.com/api/v1/notes/get_notes">

        <p>And here's exactly what I was looking for! HTTP Toolkit is showing me a request
        with all of the info I needed:</p>

        <ul type=disc>
            <li>
                The request type is GET, like I expected
            </li>
            <li>
                The number 200 is a code telling me the request was successful and the server gave me a response
            </li>
            <li>
                The URL is <code>i.instagram.com/api/v1/notes/get_notes</code>. This is what we need to pass the
                server if we want to tell it that we're trying to get some notes.
                &quot;api&quot; in this case means Application Programming Interface, the
                system of URLs and standards for HTTP requests that I need to follow in
                order to interact with the Instagram server
            </li>
            <li>
                Looking further at the request, I can see some more fields in the data that have to
                do with authentication &mdash; after you log in, a server will typically send you some
                sort of <em>authentication token</em> or something, which you can send along with future
                requests so that the server knows that you logged in recently.
                <br>I don't want to
                handle authentication myself though, and I'm sure Instagram has some sort
                of trickery to try to make it more annoying to authenticate yourself if
                you're not the Instagram app. Luckily, people have messed around with the
                Instagram API before, so I'm sure there's some sort of program someone's
                already written that can handle this stuff for me.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            I looked around and found this Python library for communicating with Instagram's private
            API: <a href="https://github.com/ping/instagram_private_api">https://github.com/ping/instagram_private_api</a>.
            There are a ton of these libraries around for different languages &mdash; their
            purpose is to let people interact with the Instagram API using programming
            languages, which is easier and less tedious than manually writing HTTP requests
            to send. Since Instagram Notes was such a new feature at the time, none of the
            libraries had been updated to support Notes, which is why I had to figure out
            the HTTP requests that are specific to Notes myself, but at least I can get a library to handle the
            authentication for me. The particular library that I found hasn't been updated
            since 2019, but it still works and it's not very complex, which is good since
            I'll need to access some of its internals.
        </p>

        <p>
            I poked around in the code and discovered that once I authenticate, I can use a hidden
            method in the library called <a href="https://github.com/ping/instagram_private_api/blob/master/instagram_private_api/client.py#L484">Client._call_api()</a>
            in order to send data to a URL in the Instagram API. The method will take the
            data I send it and add its own login data, then send that to the Instagram
            server.
        </p>

        <p>
            Since I don't need any data other than the login data for getting notes, I can just
            pass in the URL:
        </p>

        <pre>
from instagram_private_api import Client
api = Client("my_username", "my_password")
response = api._call_api(&quot;notes/get_notes&quot;)
print(response)</pre>

        <p>
            And it worked! I got a list of every note my account could see.
        </p>

        <p>
            I tried this out on my test account that didn't have Notes enabled, and as I suspected,
            I was able to see all of the notes just as easily. This didn't entirely surprise me:
            often it's easier to enable and disable a feature only on the app side and just have it
            enabled on the server side all the time for simplicity's sake. In fact, there's a good chance
            that Notes were enabled for everyone before anyone outside of Facebook had access to them
            from within the app.
        </p>

        <p>
            Does this mean apps always have tons of new features floating around that nobody can access yet?
            Surprisingly, yes. If you want to learn more, researcher <a href="https://wongmjane.com">Jane Manchun Wong</a>
            has built a social media following from analyzing popular apps like Instagram and Twitter to
            discover new features before they're announced (often by decompiling Android and iOS apps to
            find interesting data like new API endpoints, which is much more complex than what I'm doing
            here). Some of these features never even make it into the final app.
        </p>

        <p>
            What next? Well, I also want to see if I can post notes. When you press the button
            to post a note, the Instagram app, of course, sends an HTTP request. I posted a
            test note and looked at the resulting HTTP request in HTTP Toolkit:
        </p>

        <img src="img/ignotes/post_create_note_response.png" alt="HTTP Toolkit showing me an HTTP response with code 200 for a POST request to i.instagram.com/api/v1/notes/create_note">

        <p>
            Okay, this is a different type of request called a POST request, which is used for
            posting data to a server. The URL is <code>i.instagram.com/api/v1/notes/create_note</code>.
            Let's look at the data that gets sent:
        </p>

        <img src="img/ignotes/create_note_request_body.png" alt="text: still testing | _uuid: <a big long number> | audience: 0">

        <p>There are three fields here:</p>

        <ul type=disc>
            <li>
                <code>text</code> is the text of the note
            </li>
            <li>
                <code>audience</code> tells the server
                which group of people should be able to see the note. Instagram lets you
                send a note to either everyone who is mutual followers with you
                (represented here with code 0), or everyone who is mutual followers with
                you and also on your &quot;close friends&quot; list (represented with
                another code that I never bothered checking, but if I were to make a guess
                I'd say it's 1).
            </li>
            <li>
                <code>_uuid</code> is some sort of authentication data that I can get the library to handle for me.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            I can again use <code>_call_api</code> to send this data. Since <code>params</code> is a type of data that's
            only used with POST requests, the instagram_private_api library will know to
            send a POST request so I don't even have to specify that part.
        </p>

        <pre>
from instagram_private_api import Client
api = Client("my_username", "my_password")
params={
    "audience": 0,
    "text": "This is a test note",
}
params.update(api.authenticated_params)
response = api._call_api("notes/create_note", params=params)
print(response)</pre>

        <p>Again, this worked! I ran the code, and a new note immediately showed up in the app:</p>

        <p>
            <img src="img/ignotes/testnote.png" alt="a note reading \"This is a test note\"">
            <br>
            <small>
                (I forgot to take a screenshot when I was writing this, and the notes UI has somewhat changed
                since then, so this isn't exactly how the note looked when I did this thing. Sorry)
            </small>
        </p>

        <p>
            Instagram Notes have a character limit of 60 characters. So far, I've been limiting the
            notes I post using this method to 60 characters manually, just by counting the
            characters myself to make sure they don't go over. For some reason, my
            curiosity gets the better of me, and I post a note with more than 60 characters
            just to see what happens.
        </p>

        <p>
            To my surprise, it works. I post longer and longer notes, and they all seem to go
            through. The Instagram server doesn't seem to be checking the lengths of the
            notes at all.

        <p>
            If you're a bit confused as to what's going on here, I'll try to summarize the issue: the
            Instagram app contains code that checks whether the note you're writing is 60
            characters or less, and prevents you from sending the note to the server if
            it's over 60 characters. However, once the server receives the note, it doesn't
            do any sort of check on the number of characters in the note, and just stores
            it in its database without a second thought. The Instagram server has no way of
            knowing whether the note is actually coming from the Instagram app or not &mdash;
            though I'm sure Facebook wishes there were. Being able to ensure that a message
            comes from a specific client app is one of those things (like copy-protecting a
            DVD) that big tech companies would really like to have, but unfortunately for
            them, isn't really mathematically possible. This means I can send a note
            directly to the server with as many characters as I want and the server will
            post it just fine.
        </p>

        <p>
            I'd had to sign up for Facebook's bug bounty program in order to get access to the HTTP
            requests, but it didn't occur to me to actually submit a bug bounty until a bit
            later, when I tried pushing this bug to the limits. On another account, I
            created a note with about 5 megabytes of text, and then noticed that my phone
            couldn't load the messages page (which is where Instagram shows you all of your
            friends' notes).
        </p>

        <p>
            Clearly, this seemed like a security issue serious enough to warrant a bug bounty:
            anyone could post a note with a whole bunch of text and make the Instagram app
            unusable for all of their mutual followers. I had never submitted a bug bounty
            before, but Facebook was a big company, so I figured the process would be
            relatively straightforward.
        </p>

        <p>...I'm not going to go through the details of the process, but to summarize:</p>

        <ul type=disc>
        <li>
            The reporting process took about a full month. I submitted the report on July 19, and they acknowledged and patched the bug and offered me a bug bounty by August 20
        </li>
        <li>
            The initial reporting form was a little confusing. The main thing that I was stuck on was the
            category &mdash; not only were there multiple forms to submit for different
            types of bugs, but there was a dropdown in the form for almost every type
            of vulnerability imaginable:

            <p><img src="img/ignotes/vulntypes.png" width=429 height=487></p>

            <p>
                I eventually settled on the DoS (denial-of-service) category. This type of issue
                isn't the first thing I usually think of when I think of a DoS attack, but it does
                involve denying service (access to DMs) to Instagram users.
            </p>
        </li>

        <li>
            After a few days, I got a response from someone at Facebook. Their response was super interesting:
            they clarified the definition of a &quot;denial-of-service&quot; issue
            which made it more clear to me that my issue qualified... and then they proceeded
            to tell me this issue wouldn't qualify based on a few misunderstandings.
        </li>
        <li>
            I guess you can't assume everyone at Facebook has an intimate knowledge of every product: the
            &quot;notes&quot; feature was brand new, and they must not have known that
            both accounts have to be following each other to see each other's notes
            (you can't see someone's notes if you're following them but they're not
            following you). This seemed to be a source of confusion for both of us (I
            didn't figure out this detail either until some further testing after
            submitting the bug report).
        </li>
        <li>
            I sent them this video to try to make the issue clearer:

            <video src="img/ignotes/demo.mp4" controls width="100%">
                (there's supposed to be a video here, your browser might not support it)
            </video>

            <p>
                After that, they seemed to understand the issue and let me know that
                they had sent the details of my report to the product team.
            </p>
        </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Okay so that was a little bumpy, and I'd imagine that more experienced bug reporters
            are better at submitting reports in fewer steps. (I'm pretty sure there are
            people who do this stuff for a living, even). At least I know what to do next
            time (if I ever accidentally stumble on a security issue in a widely used
            commercial piece of software again): have a sense of who's going to read the
            report (someone from the security team who most likely doesn't actually work on
            the thing you're reporting the issue for outside of security-related things),
            be very clear, and send videos to clear things up.
        </p>

        <p>
            Anyway, this was pretty fun, and as sad as I am that I can't post ASCII art of a goose
            to my Instagram notes anymore (I thought I had a screenshot of this, but
            unfortunately I don't, so you'll just have to imagine), I did get some money
            out of this. Thanks Facebook!
